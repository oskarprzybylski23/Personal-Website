            <h3>I’m Oskar Przybylski /pʃɪˈbɪlski/</h3>
            <h4>he/him</h4>
            <p>
              I grew up in Poland but found myself living in London, a city that now feels like a natural habitat to
              me, with its vibrance and melting pot of cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a keen hiker and traveler, always in search of
              new adventures. Music (I play guitar) and skateboarding are other lifelong passions of mine. When I'm
              occasionally stuck at home, I tend to geek out on whatever topic sparks my interest, and more recently,
              I've been diving into coding.
            </p>
            <p>
              What truly captivates me across all my hobbies, though, are the people I meet and their stories. I am
              on a never-ending journey of learning and understanding the world around us, with the aim to create a
              positive impact for my community and the people I encounter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I work as an acoustic engineer within the architectural engineering sector. I believe that design and creation of architecture is the ultimate exercise in human collaboration. It requires seamless cooperation of countless disciplines, be it mechanical and structural engineers, sustainibility consultants, designers, architects and finally contractors and builders. I am proud that my work focuses on making our built environment a bit better and more sustainable for the public it serves. Though I have made the decision that it is time for a change and I look towards coding, I intend to seek a path that allows me to keep aligned with my principles.

        <div class="three-container box-1">
          <div class="content-text">
            <h3>Where I Am Now</h3>
            <p>
              Coming from the field of architecture, I have always been passionate about building stuff. Seeing projects
              evolve from an idea, taking shape on a drawing board, and ultimately materializing into physical
              structures that serve people is what has been really exciting to me about my work.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have started learning coding as a way to make my job easier and automate some of the more daunting tasks
              using Python. I quickly realized that there is so much more in it for me than I thought and that I have
              lots of fun working through coding problems and building my own projects. In a way, this lets me be a
              designer, architect, engineer, and builder all at once.
            </p>
            <p>
              This, combined with realizing some of the limitations of my current career path, naturally led me to the
              decision to switch careers and pursue coding as my next step. This is when I learned about Founders and
              Coders, and after doing my research, I have decided that this is the right place to help me with that
              goal.
            </p>
          </div>
          </article>
        </div>
        <div class="three-container box-2">
          <div class="content-text">
            <h3>Where I Want To Be</h3>
            <p>
              Entering the world of coding felt like stepping into a universe of endless possibilities. I have realized
              just how much impact one can create at the intersection of the digital and physical realms. With awareness
              of new technologies emerging rapidly and their profound implications, in my future work, I want to
              continue to provide positive value to society and help build software and services that enhance the lives
              of people from all walks of life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Switching to a coding career also offers the advantage of granting me greater independence in choosing
              where I want to live in the future, something that is very important to me, given my restless nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, I would not consider it if coding was not simply really fun to me. Previously, I never identified
              myself as a "computer guy", steering towards other interests on the boundary of creative and technical
              fields. Yet, it just shows that trying completely new things can bring some pretty surprising
              self-discoveries.

                This was my first attempt to create a website, which I made as a project for FAC before new projects
                were announced.

              Reaching 6kyu on Codewars was a true crash course in the basics of JavaScript. Having previously studied
              Python, I found the switch to JavaScript somewhat easier, yet still positively challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found solving Katas a great way to learn syntax and introduce some new concepts, such as RegEx.

              FreeCodeCamp was a great step in getting up to speed with the basics of HTML and CSS. The introduction of
              responsive design concepts and principles for creating different layouts and page elements really improved
              the way I approached creating my second website project, which you are looking at right now.

              Being left without a map on a hike led me to create a game based on the idea of finding your way from
              memory. It was by far the most fun and demanding project, and I will likely continue to improve it beyond
              the application process. I started with a tutorial for creating a Pac-Man clone, but quickly abandoned it
              and let my imagination guide me. I implemented various game mechanics, such as collision, water current,
              timer, and map progression.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project really pushed my JavaScript skills to a new level as I figured my way through it.
