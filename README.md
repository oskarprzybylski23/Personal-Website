## Why and How I Created it

I have created this website as one of the application projects for FAC. I intended to showcase my personality throughout the page and to create an appealing design that feels personal.
I have initially created a wireframe design using Figma. My original idea can be [seen here](https://www.figma.com/file/zz2xKwrVfes4EQ9jU8SEJv/Project-Gallery?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=DSNfAB5KVWz2iqt3-1).
I have used number of tools to help with design and creation process: 
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - interface wireframe design tool;
* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - colour pallete generation tool;
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) - photo library;
* [FreeIcons](https://freeicons.io/) - icon library;
* [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) - favicon generator;
* [Email.js](https://www.emailjs.com/) - JS email sending service;
